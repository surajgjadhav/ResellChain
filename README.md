# Resell Chain

Resell Chain is a decentralized marketplace built to facilitate the buying and selling of **secondhand goods, collectibles, and Real-World Assets (RWAs) like real estate**. By leveraging blockchain technology, NFT tokenization, and **AI-driven price prediction**, Resell Chain ensures **fair pricing, transparency, and fraud prevention** in resell transactions.

It's a monorepo of ResellChain dApp, developed using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for Frontend and [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) for backend (contracts)
